I am reading Frank Herbert's [Dune](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel\)). I will review it when I have finished it, but here's a beautiful sequence: Its called the **Litany Against Fear**. The characters repeat this to overcome fear and get back in control of themselves, in times of great terror. 

> *I must not fear.
> Fear is the mind-killer.
> Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
> I will face my fear.
> I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
> And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
> Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
> Only I will remain.*
