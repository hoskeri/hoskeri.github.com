I just finished reading Ray Bradbury's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_451">Fahrenheit 451</a>. Its my new favourite book. 

Its about - well some say it is about censorship, but it really is about the loss of the freedom to "think freely". Unlike <i>1984</i>, a book that is often compared to this one, it is not the <i>government</i> that enforces the censorship, it is the general intolerance to ideas in the wider society itself.
