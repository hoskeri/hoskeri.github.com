I love to write code iteratively. I like to write a small function at a
time, test, and then write the next piece.

Working with a statically typed, low level language makes that a little hard.

But building a little test harness that allows you call these functions
goes a long way to make programming in these languages fun again.

So I went looking for alternative options.
