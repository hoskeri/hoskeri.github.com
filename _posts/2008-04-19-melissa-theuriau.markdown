I don't know French. I don't know French politics either. But there is something in those hazel eyes that is just magical! 

An ordinary small-time news reporter now has Youtube videos made of her *reading the news*. Her legions of fans, the newest of whom include yours truly, say she deserves the fame she has. For no other reason than that she is pretty!

Have look at her:

Now, you will want to know how to pronounce the surname: Its supposed to be "TUR-ee-oh"

Also, you will want to learn French, but that is a little bit difficult to do.
