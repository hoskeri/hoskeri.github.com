Of the hundreds and hundreds of rich, detailed characters, that J K Rowling has written, Severus Snape is the most fascinating. He is, also, going by what I have heard and read several times now, one of the least understood.

When it is revealed, finally, in Deathly Hallows that Severus Snape is a good guy, many people might have found his purported motivations unconvincing. How can such an evil Death Eater be moved to turn away from Voldemort, by the mere memory of some unrequited puppy love so many decades ago? More importantly, if Snape had such integrity and courage, why should he have become a Death Eater at all?

The answers lie in understanding what it was like to be Snape. Specifically, the teen aged Severus Snape.

Snape was a misfit. 

Every one of us is expected to fit in. Conformance in thought, speech and action is expected of all us in every trivial and unimportant area. You must talk the right slang. Wear the right coloured shirt, with the right pair of shoes. Your hair must be set, just so. You *have* to be fashionable, just like everyone else. Most people just play along, busily imitating each other.

If you do not conform, or cannot understand how to win approval, you can still be accepted in your society because of what you can do for others. That's in a real society. In a school, children are forced to be with each other and given nothing to do, nothing to work together for. Hence social success in a school is generally an exercise in competitive conformance. Some kids lose this competition.

When no one wants you and everybody ignores you, one has a queer paradox of feelings for his companions. You hate their guts, and at the same time, you desperately crave their approval. You want some special ability that will make you accepted by your peers and respected at the same time. In other words, the perfect kind of raw material that goes into being Death Eaters.

But this ambition was still not enough to make Snape into a D.E. Lily Evans had a role to play.

HOLD your horses! Hear me out before you poke me with those pitchforks of yours.

Lily never meant it. She was just being a nice girl. She was just nice and neighbourly to everybody. She must have seen a lonely boy who had no friends, poor grooming and no friends to speak of, and decided to do something about it. Naturally enough, the affection starved Severus fell in love with her.

But Snape had a problem. He was in love with a girl whose personality and ability were several notches above his own. He would have seen a need to measure up to her, somehow. He saw that she was 'a dab hand' at Potions. He worked to excel at Potions too. But it wasn't enough. He needed to be grand, impressive. What grander power is there than mastery over Death itself? 

This is why Snape became a Death Eater - to measure up to Lily Evans. Snape does not fully realise the contradictions of his choices until he becomes estranged from Lily because his prejudices overcome his heart's desire. But it is too late. Death Eaters are not your Gobstones club that you can just walk out of. Being Voldemort's follower means faithful service until death.

But when he sees Voldemort interpret the prophecy he delivers, the lesson hits fully home, once again much too late. 

But if Snape is a changed man at this point, why is he so bitter towards Harry? Harry is the cruel reminder of the consequences of his choices, of what might have been, if things had worked out a little bit differently. To be constantly reminded of your guilt *every* *damn* *day* and face it manfully is too much to ask a man for.
