Its new! Its shiny! And its mine!

I bought a Compaq C 713 TU yesterday. Its the very first computer I have ever owned, so thats something. Installed Debian Lenny on it. Needed to use ndiswrapper for the Broadcom Wireless (Grrr), but *still* does not join the office net :-(. But everything else works... Intel Graphics, DRI, very cool. Will post a picture soon!
