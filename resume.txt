## Work Experience

### Atlantis Computing Pvt. Ltd. (Aug 2008 till present)

  - Worked on development of a deduplicating filesystem based on ext2/ext3
    kernel module in Linux. The ext2 filesystem was modified to perform deduplication
    of incoming data to eliminate redundant block writes and improve performance
    of virtual machines by 500%.

  - Development of features and bug fixing on 'Atlantis ILIO', which is
    a distributed server application to manage and enhance the performance of
    virtual machine disk images. This product is implemented in python.

  - Worked on converting ILIO from a centralized architecture to a distributed
    architecture to support larger scale of users and workload.

  - Built a Linux live-cd based installer for ILIO. This involved
    development of modules for setting up VMware ESX server and configuration
    of virtual machines and applications. The installer was built as a python
    application which itself ran on a virtual machine.

  - Wrote a Windows MFC application to monitor and report health of Virtual
    Machines. This application runs on user virtual machines and responds to
    commands sent over a TCP/IP socket.

  - Implemented a high availability solution for failover of services provided
    by ILIO using heartbeat, DRBD (Distributed Replicated Block Device)
    and OCFS2 (Oracle Clustered File System)

### DeepRoot Linux Private Limited. (Sep 2006 to July 2008)

  - Development and maintenance of the deepOfix Mail Server, a GNU/Linux
    distribution built to run email services.

    manageable and upgradable.

  - Fixed bugs and added features to various open source software used by the
    product. and contributed them up-stream.

  - Headed the support team, comprising four people to provide incident support
    and customizations for the above product and allied services. Responsible for
    over 200 servers in my support role.

    requirements of customers.
